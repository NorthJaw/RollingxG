# RollingxG

Expected Goals (xG) is a model which measures the quality of shots taken by a team in a football game. It takes into account several factors such as the distance from which the shot was taken, the angle towards the goal, number of defenders present between the shot taker and the goal, defensive pressure, etc. xG models have been proved to be more accurate at analysing and predicting football results than raw goal numbers. 

By plotting the rolling xG (xG average over n number of games) and xGA (xG Against) values of a team over an extended period of time, and fitting a linear regressor over the graph, we can get a sense of how the performance of a given team improves/detoriates over the given period of time. This model is one of the many basic descriptive models used by the analytics community in football.
